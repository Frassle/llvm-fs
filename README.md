# llvm-fs: An F# binding for LLVM

Note that this binding is pretty early in development and so far has only been
tested with mono on OS X. Most of the binding code is generated by bindinggen
as a part of the build process so that code is not checked into the repository.
You can see all of the LLVM interface types including generated types
[here](https://github.com/keithshep/llvm-fs/wiki/LLVM-F%23-Interface).

## Examples

The test directory contains some simple examples including an example of how
to call the LLVM API from C#.

## Building

1. Build and install LLVM as a shared library.
   Eg: `./configure --enable-shared --enable-jit && make && make install`

2. Build the LLVM binding DLL. You can use the build.bash file as a starting
   point. It's likely that the only thing you will have to change are the
   parameters which are passed to bindinggen.exe:
   `bindinggen.exe DLL_NAME LLVM_INSTALL_DIR OUT_SRC_FILE`.

3. Build your application in the same way that the tests are built.
   Eg: `fsc -r LLVMFSharp.dll test/simpletest.fs`

## Contribution Ideas

- Tests, examples & bug reports: most of the binding code was autogenerated and
  the test coverage is very low. I'm happy to have any test cases or examples
  that you can contribute.

- A cross-patform build to replace my `build.bash` and `clean.bash` files
